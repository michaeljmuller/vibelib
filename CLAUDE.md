# Project: Library Database

This is the Claude instruction file for the Library Database project.

## Documentation

Project documentation is in `documentation/`.

There is also a readme at the top level of this project.

## Project Management

Tasks are managed by "backlog.md"; see:
 - tasks/CLAUDE.md for more info
 - tasks/backlog/ is the backlog working dir

You may pull tasks assigned to you from "To do", promoting them to "In progress",
but you should not do so unless you have no in-progress tasks assigned to you.

You may work tasks assigned to you, updating the task assigned to you.

You should move tasks to "Testing" when you're done working them.

You should NOT mark tasks "Done" or archive them.

## Implementation

Always indent with spaces.  Agents caught using tabs will be taken out back and reformatted.
